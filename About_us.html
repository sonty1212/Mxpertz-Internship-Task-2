                <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
                <p>
                    We’re Christopher and Shawn, the founders of DRIVER. What<br> makes us good friends and business
                    partners is our passion for<br> people, creative solutions, sustainability, and electric
                    vehicles.<br> One
                    weekend, during a backpacking trip in the San Bernardino<br> National Forest, we discovered we could
                    make a positive impact<br> on our planet even after we left the forest. Thus, DRIVER was<br> born.
                    Through
                    self-sustainable vehicles, we could prevent carbon<br> emissions from harming the environment. With
                    one
                    rental<br> company, our goal is to inspire the community and the world to<br> opt out of renting
                    gas-powered
                    vehicles and rent sustainable <br>all-electric cars instead.

                <h2>OUR MISSION</h2>
                <p>
                    We aim to provide safe, convenient, fun, alternative transportation for short and intermediate travel.<br>
                    We’re the sustainable companion to your girls’ trip, guys' trip, or business trip. With a convenient,
                    virtual,<br> frictionless rental process, fast delivery, and safe transportation, you never have to sweat
                    your travel<br> logistics again. Environmentally conscientious customers love us and we love them. By
                    softening our<br> environmental impact, we’re inspiring our community to replace gas-powered vehicle rentals
                    with all-<br>electric vehicle rentals. Zero guilt. All fun.
